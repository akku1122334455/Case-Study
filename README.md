The dataset about McDonald's is explored. The data is loaded, and basic features like variable names, sample size, and initial rows are inspected. The data is then converted from verbal "Yes"/"No" responses to numeric binary values (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No").Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to simplify and visualize key attributes. A perceptual map is created to show how attributes relate and how customers perceive them, aiding in segmentation. here, extract segments using three methods: k-means analysis, finite mixtures of binary distributions, and finite mixtures of regressions. For k-means, we calculate solutions for 2 to 8 segments, assess stability, and identify a four-segment solution as optimal. We then compare this with binary and regression mixture models, concluding that similar segments emerge across methods, suggesting reliable segmentation.the main focus is on understanding the four market segments using a profile plot. This plot, created with hierarchical clustering, illustrates that Segment 1 sees McDonald's as cheap and greasy, Segment 2 as expensive and unappealing, Segment 3 as tasty but pricey, and Segment 4 as delicious, affordable, and somewhat healthy.
